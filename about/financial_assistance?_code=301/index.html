<h1>Financial Assistance and Outreach</h1>



<div>
<p>PyCon Australia offers a generous financial assistance programme,
so that some attendees and speakers have some -- or in rare cases, all
-- of their expenses such as flight, hotel and admission provided to
them from the conference budget.</p>

<p>PyCon Australia strongly encourages people to apply for financial
assistance -- even if we can’t cover all of your expenses, we will
give you free or discounted admission based on need. The application
process is simple, and straightforward. It’s also very liberal -- the
only caveat is that <strong>accepted speakers are given
priority</strong> so that we don’t lose a good talk because of
financial need. We also don’t ban anyone from applying.</p>

<p>Essentially, the financial assistance programme is the PyCon
Outreach programme -- it's the community holding up the community and
making itself accessible at this major event through these financial
grants. It is the very spirit of the conference: make the information,
knowledge, friendships and connection available to everyone.</p>

<p>The generous contribution of the <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/summary/">Python Software Foundation</a> has
helped us in offering this programme. Financial assistance is core to
the mission of the PSF -- The mission of the Python Software
Foundation is to promote, protect, and advance the Python programming
language, and to support and facilitate the growth of a <a
href="http://www.python.org/psf/diversity/">diverse</a>
and international community of Python programmers.</p>
</div>

<a name="Applicationanddeadlines"></a><h3>Application and deadlines</h3>
<div>
<p>To apply for financial assistance, fill out our application form.
We will offer assistance to accepted speakers as applications are
received. The first round of general applications will be considered
after Friday 3 June 2016; the second round of applications will be
considered after Friday 17 June, 2016.</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Qi5DkzE-RWU-3vxJik-KzLSD0QqUfI5k_xRdLQEe10I/viewform">Submit your application.</a></p>
</div>


<a name="Eligibility"></a><h3>Eligibility</h3>
<div>
<p>Anyone interested in attending PyCon Australia is eligible to apply
for financial assistance. Grants are allocated on the basis of need,
and applications will be assessed by our financial assistance
panel.</p>

<p>Cases that will be looked upon favourably include, but are not
limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Presenters with accepted proposals, who would otherwise not be
able afford to attend the conference.</li>
  <li>Contributors to Python Open Source projects, looking to
participate in the post-conference sprints.</li>
  <li>Members of Python-related user groups, looking to bring
knowledge back to their local community.</li>
  <li>Members of groups that encourage diversity in computing and
technology, including PyLadies groups, looking to bring knowledge back
to their local community.</li>
  <li>Students interested in Python, who can contribute knowledge of
Python back to their peers.</li>
  <li>Teachers who want to keep their knowledge of software design and development up-to-date, or want to network with other IT teachers at the Python in Education day.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, anyone whose attendance at PyCon Australia will help
improve the Python community in Australia, or around the world, is
invited to apply.</p>
</div>

<a name="AssistanceTypes"></a><h3>Assistance Types</h3>
<div>
<p>We can offer three types of assistance to attend the conference: discounted registration for your conference ticket, financial assistance for transportation and accommodation expenses associated with your attendance, and financial assistance associated with other expenses you might incur.</p>

<p>You may apply for as much assistance as you require, however,
applications seeking more funding will be reviewed more stringently.
It is also likely that we will not be able to fund the entirety of
your requested funding.</p>

<p>As a rule: ask for only as much assistance as would enable you to
attend the event. We have a limited pool of funding, and we want to
make it available to as many people as possible.</p>

<p>Exceptions to the eligibility requirements will be considered on a
case by case basis. Please e-mail <a
href="mailto:contact@pycon-au.org">contact@pycon-au.org</a></p>


<h4>Discounted or Complimentary Registration</h4>
<div>
<p>We can offer applicants either discounted, or complimentary
'enthusiast' level registration. This type of assistance is the easiest for us
to provide, and if we are unable to consider the rest of your
application for assistance, we may still consider registration
assistance.</p>

<p>At a minimum, genuine requests for registration assistance will
remain eligible for 'early bird' registration rates, regardless of
whether that rate is generally available.</p>
</div>

<h4>Transportation and accommodation assistance</h4>
<div>
<p>If you're from out of town, we can help cover reasonable travel-related expenses associated with your attendance at the conference. Types of assistance that we look favourably upon include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Costs of accommodation at a nearby hotel for the conference
nights that you're planning on attending.</li>
  <li>Costs of airfares or long-distance train tickets to Melbourne.</li>
  <li>Public transportation tickets or airport transfers</li>
  <li>Childcare expenses for the conference days you're planning on
attending.</li>
  <li>Costs for substitute teachers to cover for practising educators
attending the Python in Education Seminar.</li>
</ul>

<p>You will need to provide a rough estimate of the expenses you're
planning to claim, and explain how you arrived at your claim. We
expect you to show that you've made an effort to minimise the amount
you plan to claim, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Booking air travel on low-cost carriers such as Jetstar or
Tigerair, and booking your flights well in advance.</li>
  <li>Finding a room-mate with whom you can split the cost of your
accommodation.</li>
  <li>Booking accommodation slightly further out from the venue to
reduce costs (the conference venue is well served by public
transit).</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, if you have special needs that prevent you from doing
any of these, we'll be happy to try to accommodate you. Please contact
us by e-mail at <a
href="mailto:contact@pycon-au.org">contact@pycon-au.org</a> to discuss
your circumstances.</p>

<p>If your application for assistance is accepted, we will calculate a
maximum amount to reimburse you based <strong>only</strong> on the
assistance you have requested. We'll reimburse you after the
conference, provided you can show receipts for that amount.</p>
</div>

<h4>Other Expenses</h4>
<div>
<p>If there are other financial barriers to your attendance at the conference, we can also help.</p>

<p>Examples of assistance we can provide include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Childcare expenses for the conference days you're planning on attending.</li>
  <li>Costs for substitute teachers to cover for teachers who want to attend the Python in Education Seminar.</li>
  <li>Registration and catering costs for carers of conference attendees.</li>
</ul>
