      <title>Farewell from Brisbane</title>
      <link>http://2015.pycon-au.org/media/news/40</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s time to say goodbye from Brisbane!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you to everyone who helped make this conference happen, the team, the volunteers, the sponsors, the speakers, the papers team, our Miniconf organisers, our partners and of course our attendees.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost all of our videos have been uploaded and linked to the schedule (a couple of videos
need some manual handling).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope that you&#39;ve enjoyed yourself, learnt a lot, and made new friends: welcome to the community.  You don&#39;t have to wait till the next conference to have that feeling again, if there isn&#39;t a user group in your home town, consider starting your own.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roll on PyCon Australia 2016 in Melbourne!

      <title>Teacher assistance program</title>
      <link>http://2015.pycon-au.org/media/news/39</link>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;
As part of Carrie Anne Philbin’s keynote announcement 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://2015.pycon-au.org/media/news/38&#34;&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;, we
also announced the availability of financial assistance grants for
qualified primary and secondary teachers wishing to attend the 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://2015.pycon-au.org/media/news/35&#34;&gt;Python in Education
 Miniconf&lt;/a&gt; on July 31st.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Teachers that are interested in attending the Python in Education
Miniconf, but face financial barriers to doing so, are strongly
encouraged to &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1UrzgmIcXl499ifJglEXxKQW3oF9gHcKF1TN4a13-ZyI/viewform&#34;&gt;apply for financial assistance.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
These grants are made possible by the generous contributions of the
Python Software Foundation and Code Club Australia, and are designed
to make it easier for teachers to justify attending an education
focused event hosted by a software development conference. As such,
teachers may apply not only for assistance with registration, travel,
and accommodation costs as described for the
regular &lt;a href=&#34;http://2015.pycon-au.org/grants&#34;&gt;financial assistance
program&lt;/a&gt;, but also a contribution of up to $360 towards the costs
of hiring a substitute teacher for the day.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Keynote Speaker: Carrie Anne Philbin</title>
      <link>http://2015.pycon-au.org/media/news/38</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Following on from 2014&#39;s inspirational keynote
advocating &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVv7fCwVbp4&#34;&gt;Python
for Every Child in Australia&lt;/a&gt; as part of the rollout of the
Australian Digital Curriculum, this year sees PyCon Australia playing
host to its first
ever &lt;a href=&#34;http://2015.pycon-au.org/media/news/35&#34;&gt; Python in
Education&lt;/a&gt; miniconf. As part of that event, we are thrilled to
announce our second PyCon Australia 2015 keynote speaker: Carrie Anne
Philbin, Education Pioneer at
the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.raspberrypi.org/&#34;&gt; Raspberry Pi
Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, chair of the UK&#39;s &lt;a href=
&#34;http://casinclude.org.uk/&#34;&gt;Computing at School&#39;s #include&lt;/a&gt;
initiative, author
of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.raspberrypi.org/carrie-anne-philbins-adventures-in-raspberry-pi&#34;&gt;
&#34;Adventures in Raspberry Pi&#34;&lt;/a&gt;, and a member of the Board of
Directors for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.python.org/psf/mission/&#34;&gt;Python Software Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an award winning secondary Computing &amp;amp;
ICT teacher, Carrie Anne is a vocal advocate for the merits of
Python as an educational tool, and brings to PyCon Australia a
wealth of experience with the UK&#39;s search for a suitable text
based programming language to serve as a follow on from
self-contained visual programming environments like
Scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--break--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, while Python is already a good tool
for educational use, it&#39;s far from perfect. During the main
conference, Carrie Anne will discuss existing barriers to Python
becoming the premier language of choice for teaching computer
science, and some of the possible ways those barriers could be
lowered through improved tooling and further support from the
Python developer community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to her keynote presentation, as
part of the Python in Education miniconf, Carrie Anne will be
reviewing the Raspberry Pi Foundation&#39;s experiences in
creating and delivering the &lt;a 
href=&#34;https://www.raspberrypi.org/picademy/&#34;&gt;
Picademy&lt;/a&gt; continuing professional development
workshops for teachers in the UK, as well as facilitating small
group &amp;ldquo;birds of a feather&amp;rdquo; sessions where teachers and
interested developers can explore ways to collaborate
more effectively on both formal and informal educational
efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carrie Anne has a blended and open approach to
teaching as can be seen by her website &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ictwithmissp.co.uk&#34;&gt;ICT with Miss P&lt;/a&gt; that students use to access their weekly lessons. She uses innovative web tools to help support and extend the learning in her 21st century classroom which resulted in
becoming a &lt;a href=&#34;http://skypemoments.com/moment-makers/&#34;&gt;Skype Moment Maker&lt;/a&gt; and ambassador for technology in
2014. Carrie Anne often speaks at conferences
  like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bettshow.com/SeminarDetail.aspx?Semid=Reg14&#34;&gt;BETT&lt;/a&gt;,
  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3r_-anf1w&amp;amp;feature=share&amp;amp;list=UU_IWRSNY-l5yKrn7fI9e0Kw&#34;&gt;Raspberry Jamboree&lt;/a&gt;, YRS and
  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pyconuk.org/&#34;&gt;PyconUK&lt;/a&gt;, and is the creator of a YouTube video series for teenage girls called
  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.geekgurldiaries.co.uk&#34;&gt;The Geek Gurl Diaries&lt;/a&gt;, which has won a Talk Talk
Digital Hero Award. The episodes include interviews with women
working in technology and hands on computer science based
tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s genuinely exciting to offer such
a practical follow-up to 2014&#39;s &lt;a  href=
&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVv7fCwVbp4&#34;&gt;Python for Every
Child in Australia&lt;/a&gt; as we help forge stronger
connections between Australia&#39;s open source and educational
communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyCon Australia has endeavoured to keep
tickets as affordable as possible. We are able to do so, thanks to
our Sponsors and Contributors. Registrations for PyCon Australia
2015 are now open, with prices starting at AU$50 for students, and
tickets for the general public starting at AU$240 for the entire
conference, or $100 specifically to attend the Friday miniconfs.
All prices include GST, and more information can be found at

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the generous contributions of the
Python Software Foundation and Code Club Australia, targeted
financial assistance is available for qualified teachers wishing to
attend PyCon Australia for either the entire conference or
specifically for the Python in Education miniconf. Teachers wishing
to take advantage of this offer should apply through the
  conference&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://2015.pycon-au.org/grants&#34;&gt;financial assistance program&lt;/a&gt; and mention in
  their application that they&#39;re a qualified
teacher.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Keynote: Carina C. Zona</title>
      <link>http://2015.pycon-au.org/media/news/37</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, we revealed the programme schedule for Pycon Australia 2015 (&lt;a href=&#34;//2015.pycon-au.org/programme/about&#34;&gt;&lt;tt&gt;2015.pycon-au.org/programme/about&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). This week, it&#39;s our pleasure to announce the first of our keynote speakers for 2015, Carina C. Zona, the founder of &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/CallbackWomen&#34;&gt;@CallbackWomen&lt;/a&gt;, an initiative that aims to reduce the well-documented gender disparity in speaker line-ups at programming conferences.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
For some time now, through &lt;a href=&#34;https://storify.com/cczona/schemas-for-the-real-world&#34;&gt;Schemas for the Real World&lt;/a&gt; Carina has been advocating for developers to address the ways that seemingly incidental details of how we structure our data models can have real and lasting impacts on the way people experience the software-mediated world around them.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This year, she is taking on a new challenge, and asking us to reflect seriously on the &#34;Consequences of an Insightful Algorithm&#34;. In this era of large data sets, and rich analytical tools, we’re able to extract remarkably precise intuitions about individuals from seemingly innocuous information. But do we have a right to know details that users didn’t consent to share, even when they willingly shared the data that leads us to a particular conclusion?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
What are our obligations to people who did not expect themselves to be so intimately known without sharing directly? How do we mitigate against unintended outcomes, as when a major social network inadvertently triggered painful memories for grieving families who’d recently experienced the death of their child or other loved ones?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
As Carina puts it, &#34;We design software for humans. Balancing human needs and business specs can be tough. It’s crucial that we learn how to build in systematic empathy.&#34;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Carina is a developer, community manager, advocate, certified sex educator, and whimsical gluten-free baker. She has been an organizer &amp; instructor for many tech women’s organizations, including formerly serving on Railsbridge’s core team, and has given talks at more than 20 technical conferences among the Python, Ruby, JavaScript, and PHP communities.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
She spends a lot of time thinking about the unexpected cultural effects of our decisions as programmers.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
We can&#39;t wait to hear Carina&#39;s keynote and we are sure you will enjoy it as well.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

      <title>Financial assistance now available!</title>
      <link>http://2015.pycon-au.org/media/news/28</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;PyCon Australia 2015&#39;s financial assistance programme has opened! Financial assistance is the cornerstone of the conference&#39;s outreach programme -- the programme helps us to fund registration, travel, and accommodation expenses for deserving applicants. In doing so, we&#39;re helping to put PyCon Australia within reach of everyone who wants to attend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;d enjoy PyCon Australia, or the Australian Python community would benefit from you coming to the conference, we&#39;d love you to come along. You can find out more about the specifics of the programme on our site at &lt;a href=&#34;http://2015.pycon-au.org/grants&#34;&gt;http://2015.pycon-au.org/grants&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PyCon Australia strongly encourages people to apply for financial assistance -- even if we can’t cover all of your expenses, we will give you free admission based on need. The application process is simple, and straight­for­ward. It’s also very liberal -- the only caveat is that speakers at the conference &#34;get bumped to the top&#34; of the applications so that we don’t lose a good talk because of financial need. We also don’t ban anyone from applying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone interested in attending PyCon Australia is eligible to apply for financial assistance. Grants are allocated on the basis of need, and applications will be assessed by our financial assistance panel. In short, anyone whose attendance at PyCon Australia will help improve the Python community in Australia, or around the world, is invited to apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To apply for financial aid, fill out our application form, which you can find at &lt;a href=&#34;http://2015.pycon-au.org/grants&#34;&gt;http://2015.pycon-au.org/grants&lt;/a&gt;. The first round of applications will be considered after Friday 12 June 2015; the second round of applications will be considered after Friday 26 June, 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>One Week Left for Proposals!</title>
      <link>http://2015.pycon-au.org/media/news/25</link>
      <description>&lt;h3&gt;Under a week to go - closes Friday 8th May&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With just under a week to go until the PyCon Australia 2015 Call for Proposals closes, we thought it would be a good idea to give everyone an update and a reminder. We’re very happy with the proposals we’ve already received, but we’re eager to receive more! We hope our proposal writing working bees in Brisbane have been of help, and hope to roll them out to more cities next year. If you’ve got any questions please get in touch (numerous contact details are up on &lt;a href=&#34;http://pycon-au.org&#34;&gt;pycon-au.org&lt;/a&gt;). We would like to give a special shout out for the Education MiniConf, which is new this year: if you know people teaching and using computing in the education realm, please forward this CFP on.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The deadline for proposal submission is &lt;b&gt;Friday 8th May, 2015&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Conference&lt;/h3&gt;
The conference this year will be held on Saturday 1st and Sunday 2nd August 2015 in Brisbane. PyCon Australia attracts professional developers from all walks of life, including industry, government, and science, as well as enthusiast and student developers. We’re looking for proposals for presentations and tutorials on any aspect of Python programming, at all skill levels from novice to advanced.
Presentation subjects may range from reports on open source, academic or commercial projects; or even tutorials and case studies. If a presentation is interesting and useful to the Python community, it will be considered for inclusion in the program.
We&#39;re especially interested in short presentations that will teach conference-goers something new and useful. Can you show attendees how to use a module? Explore a Python language feature? Package an application?
&lt;h3&gt;Miniconfs&lt;/h3&gt;
Four Miniconfs will be held on Friday 31st July, as a prelude to the main conference. Miniconfs are run by community members and are separate to the main conference. If you are a first time speaker, or your talk is targeted to a particular field, the Miniconfs might be a better fit than the main part of the conference. If your proposal is not selected for the main part of the conference, it may be selected for one of our Miniconfs:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;DjangoCon AU&lt;/b&gt; is the annual conference of Django users in the Southern Hemisphere. It covers all aspects of web software development, from design to deployment - and, of course, the use of the Django framework itself. It provides an excellent opportunity to discuss the state of the art of web software development with other developers and designers.&lt;br&gt;
The &lt;b&gt;Python in Education Miniconf&lt;/b&gt; aims to bring together community workshop organisers, professional Python instructors and professional educators across primary, secondary and tertiary levels to share their experiences and requirements, and identify areas of potential collaboration with each other and also with the broader Python community.&lt;br&gt;
The &lt;b&gt;Science and Data Miniconf&lt;/b&gt; is a forum for people using Python to tackle problems in science and data analysis. It aims to cover commercial and research interests in applications of science, engineering, mathematics, finance, and data analysis using Python, including AI and &#39;big data&#39; topics.&lt;br&gt;
The &lt;b&gt;OpenStack Miniconf&lt;/b&gt; is dedicated to talks related to the OpenStack project and we welcome proposals of all kinds: technical, community, infrastructure or code talks/discussions; academic or commercial applications; or even tutorials and case studies. If a presentation is interesting and useful to the OpenStack community, it will be considered for inclusion. We also welcome talks that have been given previously in different events.
&lt;h3&gt;First Time Speakers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We welcome first-time speakers; we are a community conference and we are eager to hear about your experience. If you have friends or colleagues who have something valuable to contribute, twist their arms to tell us about it! Please also forward this Call for Proposals to anyone that you feel may be interested.&lt;/p&gt;
The most recent call for proposals information can always be found at: &lt;a href=&#34;http://pycon-au.org/cfp&#34;&gt;pycon-au.org/cfp&lt;/a&gt;

See you in Brisbane in July!
&lt;h3&gt;Important Dates&lt;/h3&gt;
Call for Proposals opens: Friday 27th March, 2015&lt;br&gt;
Proposal submission deadline: Friday 8th May, 2015&lt;br&gt;
Proposal acceptance: Monday 25 May, 2015
